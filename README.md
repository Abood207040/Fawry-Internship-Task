# Fawry Internship Task

A  Java application simulating a basic e-commerce shopping cart and checkout system. This project showcases fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java, including classes, inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation. It models a real-world shopping experience, allowing users to interact with various product types, manage their shopping cart, and complete the checkout process.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Product Types:**  
  The system accommodates a variety of products, including expirable items (e.g., cheese, biscuits), non-expirable items (e.g., TVs), and digital goods (e.g., scratch cards). Each product type implements its own logic for expiration and shipping.

- **Comprehensive Cart Management:**  
  Users can add products to their shopping cart, with built-in validation for product availability and expiration. The cart system ensures accurate stock management and prevents the purchase of expired goods.

- **Streamlined Checkout Process:**  
  The checkout service calculates the total cost, including subtotals and shipping fees, and processes customer payments. It handles errors such as insufficient balance or out-of-stock products, and generates a detailed purchase receipt.

- **Shipping Information:**  
  For orders containing shippable items, the system computes and displays the total package weight and provides a list of all shipped products.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Clear feedback is provided for issues such as out-of-stock items, expired products, and insufficient customer funds, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Clean, Extendable Design:**  
  The codebase is structured for readability and ease of extension, making it ideal for future development, experimentation, or educational purposes.
